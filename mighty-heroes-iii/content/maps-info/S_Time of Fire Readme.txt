Players: 1 human / 3 computer
Size: Small
Difficulty: Hard
Victory conditions: Find the Shackles of War
Special loss condition: Loose the hero 'Christian'

Background:
You do only what your King asks of you, and now he has sent you to find the Demon Lord Athrax and retrieve the Shackles of War the evil Demon stole at the battle of Two Peaks.
Such a quest! If you were to succeed you could be promoted up to one of the King's high generals, imagine the riches you would recieve!
You eagerly set out, along with your second in command, Crum.

Notes:
You should really use Christian to do most of the fighting and so on, otherwise the plot makes less sense.

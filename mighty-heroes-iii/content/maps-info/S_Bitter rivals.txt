 

 Thanks to Red Raven for beta testing my map and for the great advice she gave me.

Bitter Rivals is designed for a quick two player multiplay game. It pits the Dungeon and Rampart
against eachother. There has been alot of talk about Dungeon being better than Rampart and that Rampart is weak
thus this map is my answer. Both sides are even. You must either destroy youre enemy or claim all the mines.
You may find destroying the enemy to be easier.

If you do play Bitter Rivals in a single player game I suggest
playing it at the expert level. (the queen chess piece)

Description:
You could have set up a mighty Goblin empire in the Olde World, but no. For you had a dream, sent to you by the gods Gork and Mork themselves. You had visions of the future, of lands to the west inhabited by puny Elves. So you set out in great flottilas of Goblins. By the power of Gork and Mork you managed to slip through the magical shifting isles. And now you have arrived. The time of the Waaaaghh Grom is now. You will rule Ulthuan.

Notes:
This map is based on the lands of Ulthuan from the Games Workshop game Warhammer. To those who know about this I hope you enjoy visiting the sights of Ulthuan (and conquering them). To those uninitiated these lands are inhabited by the noble High Elves and their kin, and this map is taken from the Warhammer history, being the invasion by Grom the Paunch of Ulthuan. According to 'history' Grom was repulsed before his conquest could become complete, can you rewrite the history books?

I apologise for breaking any copyright rules in making this map, I just hoped to spread interest about Games Workshop.

feel free to email me (I may not answer but I will be grateful for

Read the spoilers first though because you may be able to work out why
I did certain things. (Not before you play the map though!)

I "Borrowed" a few things from my fave prog (Red Dwarf) it won't happen 
again cos I really only did it to give a friend a laugh.

The title of the map is from a song of the same name I have been 
listening to a lot lately by the Wonder Stuff with the lyrics 
"Take a jump and steal your piece of sky" (I liked it anyway)

Description:
You sail in Arkenville to stock up on supplies but notice a Golden Dragon flying from the village. When you arrive you are told this Dragon devours some villagers every month. You vow to help them, but you must hurry, for if the Golden Dragon emerges from his lair to find a hero in his domain he will destroy you and the villagers.

Notes:
The level isn't exactly hard. The main point is to complete the job as quick as possible. If you can defeat him before week 3, day 4 you have beaten my record!

(Ps If anyone can work out why this level is called Inside Information, well done)

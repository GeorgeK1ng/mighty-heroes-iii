The 8 Realms v. 1.3
by JJ the Slayer

1-8 players
NO team
Large map
Beta tested by Jer Juggernaut

Designed as a multiplayer map, but plays very well as a single player map (200% level).
It's a very difficult, but extremely fun map. Have play tested it numerous times. This
is a sweet map.

All 8 realms are represented in this scenario. Choose your town and defend your people from
extinction.

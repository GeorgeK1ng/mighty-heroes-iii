Players: 7
Size: Large
Difficulty: Hard


Background:
It is many decades since the great war. Then the Northern Druids triumphed in the north, and the Wizards of the Peaks had conquered the south. A truce was called between the two huge forces. Together they tried to rid the lands of Evil, as the Wizards and the Knights of Morn had tried many decades before. The Wizards soon developed a new form of Earth Magic wich gave them unimaginable power to shape the land itself. 
But one day, as the Druids were ripped apart by bitter infighting, the Wizards went too far...


Notes:
The third part of the Falasia trilogy, this is much more like Falasia - The Time of Conquest than its prequel Falasia - The Insurrection. So that means its a large multiplayer map with a plot for each player.

The terrain is basically the same as in F-tToC with some changes to reflect what has been going on since its predecessor, most importantly changing round where the different races begin.

As with F-tToC not all races are supposed to be equal, but each is designed to give a different challenge.

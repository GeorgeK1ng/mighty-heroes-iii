Players: 4 (in 3 teams)
Size: Large
Difficulty: Hard

Background:
The people of north west Falasia and beyond have been under the control of the rulers for many centuries, under the guidance of their god, Rho. But there are some who do not believe, some who instead follow the path of a might hero who lived in Falasia decades ago, some who wish to overthrow the rulers. These are the Knights of Morn, and they have a powerful ally in the form of the Wizards of the Peaks. War has been declared and the rulers must fight off the revelutionists and their magical allies...
...and something far worse.

Notes:
The four players are divided into three teams, the rulers (Red), the Knights of Morn (Blue) and their allies the Wizards of the Peaks (Pink), and the Demons (Orange).

This map is... different to most as blue and red (pink to a lesser extent) are at each others throats right from the start. You have to be offensive in this game. Even orange will be fighting in a few weeks. It's quite a tricky map...

Although the file name may be Falasia II, this is actually the prequel to Falasia - the Time of Conquest. The map uses the same layout as the old, except for a number of changes. This is because it is set before the Sinking, the catastrophic event that caused Falasia to be ripped apart and split into 8 factions (which is where F-tToC begins). Therefore if you played F-tToC you may be familiar with some of the landscape (but beware a lot has changed), and you can visit the lands before they were ruined.

There may even be a sequel to the original in the works (a Falasia Trilogy? - sounds good!)

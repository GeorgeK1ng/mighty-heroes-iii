Map Size Medium  4 Teams of 2 Difficulty of Map = Normal to Hard, depending on you.
To win capture Devil's Head.



Seven of you reside on the surface.  One resides below.  One of you is in league with the devil, but which one?  To win your team must destroy the subterranean city of Devils' Head.   With help, the one below will ascend, though none above can descend into the pits.... YET.   Strengthen yourself.  Find and kill the traitor.  By the time the one below arrives you will need all at your disposal to keep him at bay and capture Devils' Head.  Each of you would do well to kill the others, but remember, the primary objective is the capture of Devils Head.  There is but one way down, but you cannot access it till the underworld dweller makes his showing.  Use the intervening time wisely.

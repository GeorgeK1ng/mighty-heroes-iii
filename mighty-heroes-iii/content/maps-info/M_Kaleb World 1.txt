Notes on Kaleb World 1:

This is a medium sized map, with both surface and underworld levels.

There are 4 players, 3 of which the Human can play.  Orange is the easiest to play, and
starts with 2 castles.

It was beta tested by Dione - you should have her email address if you wish to contact her.
I made a few minor changes and added a little humor based on her input and findings I had
in a later playing of the map myself.

Storyline:  An evil underworld lord and his generals have been magically sealed forever in
the underworld...they cannot ever escape to the surface.  This has enraged the Death Knight
Set, and he has decided that if he cannot set foot on the surface world ever again, then
he will destroy it.  Somehow his necromancer magic users have concocted a plan to poke
holes in the surface world, and expand them, so that eventually all of the surface world
is obliterated.  They aren't really sure that it won't have any effect on the underworld,
but Set has made up his mind.

The world will "end" after one year...not that it should take anywhere near that long.  You
could likely shorten that time by 3 to 6 months and be OK.  Dione finished it at 130% within 
4 months playing the orange player.

Also, there is a "sub-plot" or two:  Rumors abound concerning the famous cleric Orchid Blue...
it is said that she is a prisoner against her will, and would join the forces of anyone
who can find her and free her and her formidible army.  She is, evidently, quite powerful.

Finally, there is also a seer looking for an artifact, which is in plain sight and 
conspicuously well-guarded.  I understand that the seer pays well...

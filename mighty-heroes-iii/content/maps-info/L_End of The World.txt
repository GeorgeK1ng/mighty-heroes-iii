End Of The World 
Heroes 3 map.
2 H/C-1C Hard
Large but plays like Medium.
The Human/Computer players start exactly equal. Designed as a tournement multiplayer map 
but is still excellent for single player.

The story:
The surface world is dead! Only the twin Necromancers Septienna and Aislinn remain on a 
small island. Each blames the other for the destruction of the surface world. The underworld 
teems with living creatures though, and the sisters must destroy them in order to expand
their empires and increase their undead numbers.

Homm3 Map Submission
--------------------
Name : Castle Of Pain 
(Curse of the Pagoda Men)

Author : Fierceley Thermos 
All Feedback appreciated -- Wanna see if anyone thinks I should make more maps, based on other themes(Skinmask666@hotmail.com)

Description : This is my first attempt at a Homm3 map, however after playtesting it seems to be lots of fun. The map is geared toward 4 player deathmatch style with each player occupying a corner of the map. Many little text blurbs keep gameplay fun. Also this map was designed with humor in mind, so if you want a more gritty atmosphere, look elsewhere.

Size : Medium 1 level (aboveground)

Difficulty : Hard
Player Difficulty Suggestion : Hard or better


If you dig this map, or just feel like doing Local Boston music a favor check out my Band's website at www.drawingflies.com ...
Appreciate it, and have fun! 

Homm3 rocks!

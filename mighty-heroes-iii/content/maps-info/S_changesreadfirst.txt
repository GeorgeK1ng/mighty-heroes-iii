Since I first uploaded this map I have made some changes (None of which would make the map worth replaying but I couldn't leave them the way that they are):-

I have changed the order of a couple of events so that they make a little more sense.
I have made numerous changes to spelling and grammer (Not the English spellings though, they will still look wrong to most of you)

I have changed the DOS name for the map from Sky.mx2 to Pieceof.mx2, many people will have noticed that the map was out of sequence in their menus because of this (I still didn't though duh!!) So if you did download this before and you do intend keeping it then don't forget to delete the other one.

My other maps include:- The Cloak, Avalanche and the soon to be finished Chaos Theory.

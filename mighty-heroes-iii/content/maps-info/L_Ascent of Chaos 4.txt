A word from the Creator
Well this is the final chapter of Ascent of Chaos, I hope that you have played my maps and find it to your taste. The story from my Maps came from the game Blood & Magic by Interplay and took place in the Utter East in the Forgotten Realms setting. I have fun playing the game and so create the Ascent of Chaos maps as i like the Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books. Note that if Tartyon is defeated, he will be cast down into the pits of the Abyss as a Tanar'ri, some of the fallen gods of the Forgotten Realms are exile there as Tanar'ri, an example is Lorth, Spider Queen of the Drow and former Goddess of Dark Elven Destiny. She was exile for attempting to kill Corellon Larethian, Lord of the Elves. Hope that you will succeed and claim Tartyon's godhood!

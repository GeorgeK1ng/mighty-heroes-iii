Hallo,

This is map of Europe (version 1.3 - April 1999)

The map also includes Northern Africa and European Part of Russia. Choosing the colour of player determines the nationality you want to fight for:
1-Red-Poland;
2-Blue-France, Italy, Greece;
3-Tan-Skandinavia;
4-Green-Germany;
5-Orange-Great Britain, Holland;
6-Purple-Muslim States;
7-Teal-Spain, Czech, Hungary;
8-Pink-Russia, Ukraine;
Each player has one hero with 8 skills on basic level. Don't lose them !
These 8 heroes and their skills were based on real persons. They are or were friends of mine.

During conquering you will be haunted by voices giving you experience. The voices are taken from Virgin Prunes lyrics and this is my tribute to this band.

The hero named Dorothea is the most beautiful female ever born on Earth. This is true person. (My girlfriend !)

				Enjoy

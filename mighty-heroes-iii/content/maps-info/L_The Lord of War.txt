update:
		based on the review by Lok (Mike Ferry) I changed some details: 
		the last enemy heroes do no longer owe the orb of inhibition
		nor the shackles of war. Also they are less resistant to magic, 
		so the last fights will be easier to win ( I did not say easy!).
		based on the kind comments of Roberto Ulfig the following changes
		have been added:
		no more dragon utopias (to prevent the player from flying and
		dimdooring
		the necromancers were give a whole lot of more resources (due to
		H3 timed event bug)
		a wrong event is has been replaecd.

Map:
Realm of the Destroyer

Author:
Scott "Sorak" Lufkin

Description:
A resource heavy map, you have 2 towns (1 random, one not) and are well 
defended by wandering monsters, so you have some time to develop.  Should
be some good fights with everyone having so many resources and 2 towns.

Statistics:
Resource Heavy, 6 players, non -coop (but was designed to be also, just
select teams from the map secs in the editor and select to taste)

Size: Medium (2 levels), Normal Difficulty

Known bugs:  The last 2 maps I have made (not including this one) have 
had some areas that you just can't get to, even though map validation 
doesn't pick it up.  I have fixed those and I believed them to be great 
maps now!  Enjoy, and if you find any problems just go ahead and fix them
as you feel necessary.  This map should be really well balanced for all 
but the Pink unplayable player, who is an optional quest.  (He is the 
destroyer.)

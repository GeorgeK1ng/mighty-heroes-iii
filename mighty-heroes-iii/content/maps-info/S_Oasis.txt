feel free to email me (I may not answer but I will be grateful for 
your feedback)


There are a lot of events on the map (all of which should be triggered 
just by playing the game). I have tried to make it so that while you're 
playing the game it is like a storyline. However it is possible to trigger
the occasional event out of sequence if you have a totally different
way of playing Heroes2 to me. It shouldn't spoil it for you though.
 
One important note:- The plural of Oasis is Oases (Just to stop a mountain of emails telling me it isn't). If you don't believe me check your dictionary (British English only - I can't vouch for anyone else's)

Don't forget that you can now rate maps as you play them at Astral 
Wizards site. Look there for details.

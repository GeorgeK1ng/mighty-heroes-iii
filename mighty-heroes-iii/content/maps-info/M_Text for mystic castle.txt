The Idea of the game is to use the town portal spell to get to reds second castle then tool up and go bashing your neighbours.  Red can only accuire the town portal spell from the seer who requires the dead mans boots, the other two seers give you expert earth magic and expert wisdom to make sure you can use it.

The power liches have the vampires cowl and some vampires follow closely behind

Dread Knights have the Amulet of the Undertaker some skeletons guard the treaseure

The ghost Dragons have the Dead mans Boots and more Skeletons guard the treasure.

there are two pandora boxes on the middle island the blessed ground one contains all of the "all attribute modifiers", some experence(20000), luck, moral, and 50 spell points but a nasty fight is required to get them

the other box contains the same ammount of luck etc but the artifacts are the four, "get loads of this attribute but suffer a drop in this attribute"

If you are not playing red then to win you will have to get the "mystic" castle that requires a magic jump (Town Portal, dimention door, fly), if you are not red then it can't be town portal!  There is only one small slot that a hero can fit into, just behind the castle, it looks like you are going into the roof.

enjoy

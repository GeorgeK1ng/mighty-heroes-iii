Description:
You return to Haranroth to find evil festering at its core, can you save the lands? You must search every inch of the terrain for whatever help you can find, but beware for evil has rotted the lands and lurks everywhere.

Notes:
My first real single player map, and my favourite. I therefore would appreciate any feed back you can give me.

Players: 1 human, 4 Computer
Size: Small
Special Loss Condition: Lose Ragnosh the Battle Mage

Description:
Ragnosh has been chosen by his god to prove the might of the Stronghold.
Can you lead him to victory?


Notes:
This is a map designed to test your tactical skills with the Stronghold. There are no buildings to construct, or resources to be managed, it's just 4 big sieges.
Due to a few random elements in the game of HOMM3, sometimes this map can be very hard and sometimes slightly too easy. So try it a few times and see how good you really are.

Tip:
At the start, only choose skills useful in combat.

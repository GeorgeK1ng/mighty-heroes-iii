Description:
In ages past a trio of wizards flew into the otherwise impenetrable Icefinger Mts using the Angel Wings and colonised the area.
They founded three great cities but alas they lost the Angel Wings deep underground.
Now relations between the cities have become strained as each races to find the Wings and escape the Icefingers.

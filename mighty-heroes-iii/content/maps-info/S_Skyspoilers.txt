You may as well choose impossible level since you lose all your wood 
and ore at the start of the game.

The enemy can't get to you.  The map is made so that you go after 
them (There aren't all that many either)

The whole point of the map is as an adventure(ish) type thing .
so read the signs, the rumours and events properly the few clues hidden 
in there will help you solve the map easily enough.

You will need the book of the elements from the sphinx (the answer will 
be provided at the end of the month - just in case you can't solve it)

You will need the elemental ring guarded by the medusa.

Just before the last area of the map you will gain both the U.A. and 
a scroll of summon fire elemental.

Gain as many skeletons as you can before the 2nd last enemy hero
because from there you will lose alot of troops (Probably)

This is where the elementals come in - you need them to draw fire from 
your other troops because if you finish the battle without any other 
troops you will lose.

You may need the pendant of death (Guarded at the start by 3 bone 
dragons) this is because the last enemy hero may have Holy Shout!

Don't forget to travel through the whirpool on land (I didn't
know that it would work either)

I think that's about it.

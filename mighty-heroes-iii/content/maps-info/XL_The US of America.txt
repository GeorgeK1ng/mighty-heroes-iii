I just finished testing your map.  (I played it on normal.)  First of all,
the layout of the basic map (terrain features) is gorgeous.  You did a
wonderful job of creating North America.  The landmarks (like Carlsbad
Caverns for a dungeon) and the placement of the cities, even the types of
cities chosen was wonderful.  (Too bad there isn't a greedy bloodsuckers
castle for Washington DC).  The touches of humor were marvelous.  I loved
the devils in Beverly Hills.

My personal preference is not to have an ally.  I found green to be of no
help and somewhat of a hindrance since all he did was run around and snap
up all the artifacts, towns and mines.  He never engaged in combat against
teal or tan.  He only took over neutral towns.  You might consider making
this a co-operative map for two people (green and blue) against tan and
teal.  If not, you need to get rid of green as an ally and make him an
opponent.

Once I took over the west coast, the map ceased to be hard and became quite
easy, especially after I acquired the Angel Wings.  Did you realize that
Angel Wings allows you to reach the artifacts without fighting the monsters
that guard them?  I just "flew" around the map and in no time I had a nifty
sword, a great helmet, armor, boots, etc. and my little 10th level Michael
suddenly had archangels and stats in the twenties.  Nothing was much of a
challenge after that point, especially since I just flew by the green
border guards and went in and got the resources and tomes of magic in the
underground.

I don't believe that making the monsters tougher is the answer.  I would
find the map much more enjoyable if you toned it down and exchanged those
top of the line artifacts for less powerful ones.  Judging from the maps
I've tested, it seems to be difficult to make a map that starts out hard
and gets harder - most of them start out hard and by the time you get
through the hard part, your hero is so tough that everything else is easy.
Putting hundreds of monsters in the last castle is not a creative answer.

You might consider starting teal off with three castles instead of two.
Give him Washington DC too.  Tan is blocked off by the border guards.  (I
really enjoyed that touch of humor.)  Maybe give him a shipyard so he can
go to sea?  If he had one already, he certainly didn't use it.

Well, I hope my comments have helped you somewhat.

Thanks for the map. I have posted it on my webpage. The USA flag is 
really neat, it must have taken you a whole day to build that map.

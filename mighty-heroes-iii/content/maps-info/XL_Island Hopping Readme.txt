Description:
Somewhere within the Sea of Tempests is hidden the Grail, the mightiest artifact known to man.
To own it would be to rule the world! But there are others out for it too and worse still it is hidden within the many islands dotted around.
Can you find the Grail, or defeat the other races before they do?

Description:
You are George, renowned treasure hunter. Now you are after the biggest prize of all, the Tome of Earth Magic.
You have heard it is buried deep underneath the Great Desert. To get there you must find the City of the Dead, and there you will find a way into the Halls of the Dead.
Of course you have heard that there is a curse on anyone who enters the Halls, and that the dead stalk the corridors. But you don't believe in anything like that do you?

Notes:
This is quite a different level to most, and therefore there are a few problems. The main one is that eventually a week will come where loads of creatures get placed across the map, like during 'The Week of the Liche' or whatever. The map has been carefully balanced and with these additional monsters it often proves actually impossible to complete the map. My only tip is to save at the end of Day 7 every week and then if the next week creates new monsters reload your saved game and try again. It's annoying but can be worth it.

Tips:
Your troops are fragile and definetely NOT expendable. Keep them safe.

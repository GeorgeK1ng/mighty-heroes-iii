Size: Small
Players: 3

Background:
It is the aftermath of a great war, three years on and the land is still ruined, most of the old armies having split up and are now living in camps around the territory. Now three villages have sprung up, and the mayors have already declared war! But with little resources or troops, and mosters roaming the lands, this is going to be tough.

Notes:
The computer is not very good at playing this map so if you are having a go on your own try it on at least hard difficulty.

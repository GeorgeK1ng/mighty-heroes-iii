A word from the Creator
This map is large size but due to the story-line, it can last twice as long as other normal large
maps. Try to use Aasash to create throngs of skeletons and use them as vanguard of Tartyron's
army. To fully enjoy the game, please play it in normal mode, as with easy the computers will 
make silly mistakes a lot. The Final map is about Tartyron's fight to defeat the Circle and 
regain his godhood. (The Circle wouldn't die as they are gods and Tartyon only force them to 
leave the earthly plane when he kill their bodies. But Tartyron is imprisoned by the Circle and
so only process a earthly form when he waked from the Tomb of the Ancients)

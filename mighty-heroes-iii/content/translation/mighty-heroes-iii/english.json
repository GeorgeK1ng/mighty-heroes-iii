Just be glad I don\"t call you \"Alko Mort\" - Already Dead.\" The nomad laughs at this and turns back to leading the way.  You frown, realizing this man\"s sense of humor is as dry as this desert.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.2.description" : "And for another moment, panic seizes you.  \"BLIND!\" your brain screams, but then it registers slowly in your swollen mind that you must open your eyes to see.\n",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.20.description" : "As you ride through the hot desert, you are eternally aware of the lazy circling of the carrion birds above.  \"Take your time,\" they seem to say.  \"We\"ll dine whenever is good for you.\"  Between the heat, the omnipresent birds, and your lack of memory, irritation drenches you like a thunderstorm.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.21.description" : "Koltair seems to warm to you.  He rides beside you, sometimes sharing your silence, other times taking the opportunity to point out landmarks or peculiar plantlife.  \"That is the \"Canteen Cactai\",\" he says, \" It can hold up to a gallon of water within its spiny trunk..\" he trails off. ",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.22.description" : "Despite his friendliness, Koltair\"s companions seem distrustful of you.  Grag especially remains aloof, eyeing you like a cat eyes a mouse.  \"Don\"t worry,\" Koltair assures you, \"One must prove himself worhty of Grag\"s trust.

It is as if your mind is dangling a carrot in front of you, taunting.  \"I know everything,\" it says. \"Let\"s see if you can figure it out...\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.24.description" : "Sometimes you see glimpses of your past.  Faces you don\"t recognize.  Voices that sound familiar, but you can\"t place.  Snowy mountains, dense swamps.

	"map.l_goldhear.event.25.description" : "But they don\"t, and soon the visions disappear, replaced with blackness.  All you know is desert and these darkskinned nomads, who look at you even now with contempt, with distrust.  Can you even remember what a pine tree looks like? Snow? A lake?  With sadness, you ride onwards, in a foggy reality.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.26.description" : "It has been several days since you found Ellabel\"s body in the desert, and yet you still remember the look of pain and horror on her wrecked face.  Who had killed her? Why? Reaching into your saddle bag, you take out the crumbled, bloodstained note. What did it mean?",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.27.description" : "Why had Roger apologized?  Was he at all connected with you? Who had killed that beautiful creature?  \"Still trying to figure it out?\" Koltair says, riding up next to you. \"You are going to stare a hole into the paper if you look at it any longer.\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.28.description" : "You chuckle, trying to sound cheerful.  It is a halfhearted attempt.  Two weeks since you awoke, and your amnesia has gotten no better.  \"Do not worry,\" Koltair says, \"In Erlos, we shall learn much.  I hear the ruling lord there has a gift for divination.\" But what if we don\"t? you want to ask.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.29.description" : "You look back to Koltair\"s companions and the small gathering of mercenaries you\"ve managed to attract.  They look like a motley bunch, walking along in the sand in their tattered clothing carrying rusted weapons notched with age and wearing what pieces of armor they could find.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.3.description" : "Your lids part sluggishly, as if they were set to rusty hinges, letting in a sliver of painfully bright light.  You gasp at the onslaught of the sudden stimulus, but find your throat is too parched to utter sound.  A swollen, bone-dry tongue makes its way over cracked and severely chapped lips. ",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.30.description" : "\"They are the children of the desert,\" Koltair said, recognizing your thoughts.  \"They may not look like much, but they are hard, weathered fighters.  They will come through for you.  I\"ve seen Arythian knights fall to much worse looking than them before..\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.31.description" : "You turn back around.  The heat is sweltering, but Koltair and these desert folks look as resiliant as always.  Every ray of sun hits you like a brick, but it seems to drip off these men like water. They seem totally unaffected. \"In Erlos...\" you whisper.  But how long until Erlos?",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.32.description" : "Another day spent in this damn cave.  Another day without sun.  Another day without hope.  Another day without memory.  The darkness is starting to get to you, and you almost yearn for the hot, unbearable days spent out in the desert sun.  Would this cave even take you anywhere?",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.33.description" : "Koltair shook his head.  \"I do not know these caverns,\" he said.  His companions didn\"t know either.  For the last week or so, they have seemed to drop their hostility towards you.  Grag even slapped your hand yesterday after ambushing a small group of goblins.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.34.description" : "\"Did you hear that one\"s skull go C-R-R-RACK when I hit him with that rock!?\" he had said to you excitedly, making a crunching motion with his hands.  You had smiled, glad to finally be earning the friendship of these men. This man who took pleasure out of squishing little green creatures.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.35.description" : "Koltair had become a good friend over the last two weeks. The two of you fought side by side, like brothers. He shared things with you, personal things. He had told you about his father, who had sacrificed his life to save his son. \"Understand that men are bad, and trust none of them,\" Koltair said.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.36.description" : "\"Those were my father\"s last words as he lay dying, the tusk of a behemoth protruding from his chest.  What kind of last words are those?\"  Koltair had stared at you, tears in his eyes.  And though you didn\"t envy his pain, you were jealous of his ability to remember.  To know his father.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.37.description" : "And now, the darkness of the caves once again surrounded you. It was ironic in a way, traveling in this cave. The darkness was outside your head and inside it.  Yes, Koltair and his men had become friends, and for that you are happy, but what of your previous friends?  Who were they?",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.38.description" : "Would you ever look upon them again?  In some ways you dreaded meeting them, if ever you would. What would they tell you.  What if they told you you were a murderer, a thief, a raper of women?  Could you deal with the news?  Perhaps it would be better to stay in the cave, stay in the dark...",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.4.description" : "The thought of water makes your entire body cry out in pain, and your eyes instinctively jerk completely open in order to look for water.  The merciless brilliance of the noon sun once again stuns you, but this time the effect vanished more quickly.  ",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.5.description" : "You try to sit up, but are too weak.  Instead, you merely look around from your lying position, only to see miles of yellow sand and the occasional lonely palm or cactus.  Brown cliffs shimmer in the heat in the far distance to either side of you, and above the carrion birds circle lazily, waiting..",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.6.description" : "The questions come to you naturally. Where were you? How did you get here?  And, indeed, what was your name?  You remember nothing, and even after moments of strain, you can\"t seem to force an answer from your crippled memory.",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.7.description" : "You attempt again to stand, to somehow improve your situation by movement, but only succeed in collapsing into an even more uncomfortable position.  So this is it, you think.  This is how you will die.  Alone, parched, in agonizing pain, and without any knowledge of how it happened.  \n",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.8.description" : "Suddenly, consciousness slaps you in the face again, and you, not even aware that you had blacked out, curse the gods for not allowing you to at least die in peace.  \"I am not the gods,\" a sandy voice replies, \"But you shall be meeting them soon if you do not drink!\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.event.9.description" : "You nearly laugh.  So now you will become insane as well?

As the south\"s most important trading center, the city offers easy access to merchants from all lands, and, not surprisingly, the law is not too discriminating about who can and cannot enter.",

A few lazy creatures stand atop it, their bows leaning against the walls out of reach.  Could this be another way into Valan\"s stronghold?

You cross your fingers, hoping for any bit of information, and approach cautiously, as if fearing the corpse might rise from the earth and strike you down.  The wind relents, and you find Koltair beside you.",

You limp over to him, hindered by your inexperience with the crutches, and sit down.  The fire crackles and pops, and for a moment, you do not speak.  Koltair stares at you but says nothing.",

I was alone?\"  Suddenly brought out of his personal musings, he pauses to think.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.33.8.1.message" : "(3) But there was no mistaking it now.  Roger was back, and instead of bringing his precious daughter, he brought an army.  Every Arythian city save Roger\"s home town of Valkynborg to the snowy north had fallen to the armies from the east. And now Caryngton, last bastion of hope, had fallen too.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.11.0.message" : "(3) As you get nearer, you see that Koltair is right -- the birds had already gotten to the corpse.  From ten feet away, you can also clearly see that the body was indeed female.  Finally, you find yourself able to kneel by the side of the corpse and inspect it closely.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.3.0.message" : "(6) His friends seem equally intrigued, and you give them a pained smile while warming your hands.  Finally, Koltair speaks, \"I see my mother has fixed you well.\"  He pats your leg roughly, causing it to burn with pain.  You flinch inwardly, not wanting for some reason to appear weak to these men.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.4.0.message" : "(7) One of the other nomads speaks to you suddenly.  \"Apro Mort, what is your name?  Where are you from?\"  He seems genuinely interested, and you wish you had a definitive answer for him.  Lacking even an inkling of your origins, you reply, \"I remember nothing.  It is as if I was born yesterday...\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.5.0.message" : "(8/18) The nomad nods and returns to his whiskey.  Quiet again follows as the men stare into the dancing flames, chewing their dinners or sipping liquor.  Koltair offers you a flask.  \"Distilled from cactus pulp,\" he says, but you politely decline.  The mere thought of alcohol makes you queasy.\n",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.6.0.message" : "(9/18) The other nomad breaks the silence again, his features scrunched in thought.  \"You have the light hair and large eyes of a northerner.  Your skin is fair and your lips tight.  My guess is that you hail from the northern reaches of Aryth.\"",

We have never seen him since.  Ah, but I digress...\" The man turns away, eyes full of tears.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.34.8.1.message" : "(4) Roger rode tall and proud on his white steed, cantering confidently through the smashed gates of Sorlan\"s castle.  The King, having too much pride to scurry fearfully to his captor\"s feet, made his way slowly but deliberately to the main courtyard of Caryngton.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.35.11.0.message" : "(4) A first look sends your stomach lurching and for a moment you fear you might vomit.  Most of the face is gone, including the eyes, and several organs lay in pieces on the ground beside the body.  Eventually, you are able to overcome the nausia and attempt to examine the body again.",

Arcs of green magical energy burst from the surface of the portal and strike the ground in front of it.

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.35.8.1.message" : "(5) Finally, Sorlan arrived, and pulling his stately robes about him as regally as he could, he finally looked his one-time friend in the eyes.  He saw nothing there but malice and condescension.  \"Why?\" was all Sorlan could manage to say.  In such shock, more elegant words failed him.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.36.10.0.message" : "(5)  She was young, you conclude, noting the smooth skin and dark, curly hair.  \"Perhaps thirty, as old as I,\" you mumble to yourself, noting for the first time your own apparent age.  She  was wearing no jewelry and there are no other identifying marks on her body.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.36.8.1.message" : "(6) His friend Roger seemed amused by this.  He wore an expression as if to say, \"Come now, drop the ruse. Do not belittle our intelligence on top of everything else.\"  Finnaly, he spoke.  \"King Sorlan, I presume?\"  The king\"s brow furrowed in confusion.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.37.10.0.message" : "(6)  \"Damn,\" you curse.  Nothing at all, a dead end.  Suddenly, something catches your eyes, sticking out of the corner of her tattered shirt.

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.37.5.0.message" : "(11) \"But look at this one,\" he indicates a neat, three inch long cut in the upper abdomen, right below the right breast.  \"No bird did this.  A sword, perhaps, maybe a spear.  Not the best place to stab someone - that would be the left side.  It does the job, though.\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.37.9.1.message" : "(7)  \"Of course it is I,\" Sorlan replied.  \"We\"ve been friends for years. And yet you bring an army to my walls instead of a daughter to my gate.

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.38.4.0.message" : "(12)  \"I would imagine she was killed long before the heat got to her,\" Koltair concludes, standing up. He thinks for a minute and then adds, \"So, someone wanted her dead, though why  they brought her all the way out here to put a blade in her chest is beyond me.\"",

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.38.9.1.message" : "(8) Roger\"s confidence visibly wavered as thoughts ran through his mind.  Something the King had said confused him.  \"Ellabel, as you must know, is dead, killed by the hands of your own men,\" Roger finally asserted trying to reassure himself.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.10.1.message" : "(9) This news had a profound effect on the king, who suddenly dropped his guard on his emotions.  \"What?\" he shrieked. \"My daughter is dead? How?  Where?  When?\"  The tears flowed freely, and Sorlan fell on his knees.  Roger looked confusedly to his nomad friend.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.2.0.message" : "(14) \"Anything else?\" you ask.  \"Only the dead horse some distance to the south,\" he replies, rubbing his chin.  \"Don\"t bother,\" he adds, \"We checked it the first time through and found nothing.  I think it was stolen.  Had a broken leg.\"  Both of you are silent for a while.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.3.1.message" : "(8) \"The cave beyond is infested by the most foul creatures.  Not even alive, they are.  Tread carefully.  Now, is there nothing else I may offer you?\"  You think for a moment, but can think of nothing, so you tell the water spirit no.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.63.0.message" : "You find the entrance to a small cave hidden behind a conspicuous clump of trees.  The sound of running water can be heard within.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.7.0.message" : "(10)  \"Look,\" he says, pointing at the body.  \"These,\" he says, indicating the several gaping holes in her abdomen, \"were done by carrion birds.

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.39.9.0.message" : "(8) You read the message several times, trying to glean some meaning from it, but you are at a total loss.  You can make no sense of it.  Suddenly, Koltair is beside you, staring at the corpse.  You feel like crying, as all your hopes of finding out who you are seem suddenly smashed.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.4.5.1.message" : "(7) \" As time wore on, the greater gods began to notice the effects of greed running through the humans, however; they realized the necessity of envy and hate and evil among the people of their world, but to see their creations killing each other for gold made no sense to them.\"",

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.40.10.1.message" : "(10) Surely, Roger mused, this is not the act of a skilled thesbian.  These tears were real, not conjured.  So the murder of Ellabel had not been by his order.  What other false pieces of information had Valan passed along to the unsuspecting Lord of Valkynborg?",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.40.3.0.message" : "(15) Thoughts race through your head: if she came from the north, why was her dead horse to the south?

Is there another exit to this cave?\"  Silence for a moment, accompanied by a blurring of the watery face.  And then it is back.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.41.4.0.message" : "(16)  You frown, unconvinced.  Unfolding the letter, you show it to the nomad and ask him if he has any idea who Roger of Valkynborg is.  \"Never heard of him,\" Koltair replies.  \"Though Valkynborg is a small mountain province in the northern regions of Aryth I believe.  So this must be Ellabel?\"",

The words come to your mouth without thought, \"Can you tell me who I am?\"   The face contorts into gentle laughter.  \"Mortal, I am not privy to information such as that.  Surely, you must know your own name?\"",

You nod, feeling that going north is the only way you will find anything out.  Silently, your party leaves the area, heading north.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.43.106.1.message" : "\"HEY!\" a voice rumbles.  You look up.  \"Those are my shoes!\"  It is a titan.  Unfortunately, he is accompanied by several of his friends.",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.43.11.1.message" : "(12) Again the King breaks into tears, and you must once more stop your story.  You\"ve been here for hours, relaying the story that Valan told you and how you woke up in the desert remembering nothing.  \"Ahhh,\" was all Sorlan could say between sobs, \"He is a cunning one, he is.\"",
	"map.l_goldhear.guards.43.4.1.message" : "(4)  Without thinking, you blurt out, \"Who are you?\"  Silently, you curse yourself for your lack of control.  This is like a genie\"s wish, not to be wasted frivolously.  Whoever this is, she might be able to answer real questions.  \"I am Inshamam, a Water Spirit.  I sustain the essence of water.\"",

	"map.l_goldhear.guards.45.4.1.message" : "(2) Suddenly, a hollow, soothing female voice speaks to you.  The sound is intoxicating, and seems to come from far away, although you can\"t place a direction.

Two weeks since you awoke, and your amnesia has gotten no better.  \"Do not worry,\" Koltair says, \"In Erlos, we shall learn much.  I hear the ruling lord there has a gift for divination.\" But what if we don\"t? you want to ask.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.event.29.description" : "You look back to Koltair\"s companions and the small gathering of mercenaries you\"ve managed to attract.

You gasp at the onslaught of the sudden stimulus, but find your throat is too parched to utter sound.  A swollen, bone-dry tongue makes its way over cracked and severely chapped lips. ",
	"map.l_goldheartex.event.30.description" : "\"They are the children of the desert,\" Koltair said, recognizing your thoughts.  \"They may not look like much, but they are hard, weathered fighters.  They will come through for you.  I\"ve seen Arythian knights fall to much worse looking than them before..\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.event.31.description" : "You turn back around.  The heat is sweltering, but Koltair and these desert folks look as resiliant as always.  Every ray of sun hits you like a brick, but it seems to drip off these men like water. They seem totally unaffected. \"In Erlos...\" you whisper.  But how long until Erlos?",

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.33.8.1.message" : "(3) But there was no mistaking it now.  Roger was back, and instead of bringing his precious daughter, he brought an army.  Every Arythian city save Roger\"s home town of Valkynborg to the snowy north had fallen to the armies from the east. And now Caryngton, last bastion of hope, had fallen too.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.34.11.0.message" : "(3) As you get nearer, you see that Koltair is right -- the birds had already gotten to the corpse.  From ten feet away, you can also clearly see that the body was indeed female.  Finally, you find yourself able to kneel by the side of the corpse and inspect it closely.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.34.3.0.message" : "(6) His friends seem equally intrigued, and you give them a pained smile while warming your hands.  Finally, Koltair speaks, \"I see my mother has fixed you well.\"  He pats your leg roughly, causing it to burn with pain.  You flinch inwardly, not wanting for some reason to appear weak to these men.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.34.4.0.message" : "(7) One of the other nomads speaks to you suddenly.  \"Apro Mort, what is your name?  Where are you from?\"  He seems genuinely interested, and you wish you had a definitive answer for him.  Lacking even an inkling of your origins, you reply, \"I remember nothing.  It is as if I was born yesterday...\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.34.5.0.message" : "(8/18) The nomad nods and returns to his whiskey.  Quiet again follows as the men stare into the dancing flames, chewing their dinners or sipping liquor.

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.34.8.1.message" : "(4) Roger rode tall and proud on his white steed, cantering confidently through the smashed gates of Sorlan\"s castle.  The King, having too much pride to scurry fearfully to his captor\"s feet, made his way slowly but deliberately to the main courtyard of Caryngton.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.35.11.0.message" : "(4) A first look sends your stomach lurching and for a moment you fear you might vomit.

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.38.9.1.message" : "(8) Roger\"s confidence visibly wavered as thoughts ran through his mind.  Something the King had said confused him.  \"Ellabel, as you must know, is dead, killed by the hands of your own men,\" Roger finally asserted trying to reassure himself.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.39.10.1.message" : "(9) This news had a profound effect on the king, who suddenly dropped his guard on his emotions.  \"What?\" he shrieked. \"My daughter is dead? How?  Where?  When?\"  The tears flowed freely, and Sorlan fell on his knees.  Roger looked confusedly to his nomad friend.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.39.2.0.message" : "(14) \"Anything else?\" you ask.  \"Only the dead horse some distance to the south,\" he replies, rubbing his chin.  \"Don\"t bother,\" he adds, \"We checked it the first time through and found nothing.

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.39.9.0.message" : "(8) You read the message several times, trying to glean some meaning from it, but you are at a total loss.  You can make no sense of it.  Suddenly, Koltair is beside you, staring at the corpse.  You feel like crying, as all your hopes of finding out who you are seem suddenly smashed.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.4.5.1.message" : "(7) \" As time wore on, the greater gods began to notice the effects of greed running through the humans, however; they realized the necessity of envy and hate and evil among the people of their world, but to see their creations killing each other for gold made no sense to them.\"",

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.40.10.1.message" : "(10) Surely, Roger mused, this is not the act of a skilled thesbian.  These tears were real, not conjured.  So the murder of Ellabel had not been by his order.  What other false pieces of information had Valan passed along to the unsuspecting Lord of Valkynborg?",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.40.3.0.message" : "(15) Thoughts race through your head: if she came from the north, why was her dead horse to the south?

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.41.11.1.message" : "(11) Roger climbed down from his horse and lifted the sobbing king from the muddy earth.  \"Your highness,\" he said with compassion, \"I fear I may have been duped.  Please, let us talk.  I am perhaps more confused than you are.\"  Roger motioned for his men to lay down their arms and prepare to camp.",

Is there another exit to this cave?\"  Silence for a moment, accompanied by a blurring of the watery face.  And then it is back.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.41.4.0.message" : "(16)  You frown, unconvinced.  Unfolding the letter, you show it to the nomad and ask him if he has any idea who Roger of Valkynborg is.  \"Never heard of him,\" Koltair replies.  \"Though Valkynborg is a small mountain province in the northern regions of Aryth I believe.  So this must be Ellabel?\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.42.3.1.message" : "(5) \"But surely, there is something I can give you?\" Inshamam adds.  The words come to your mouth without thought, \"Can you tell me who I am?\"   The face contorts into gentle laughter.  \"Mortal, I am not privy to information such as that.  Surely, you must know your own name?\"",

You nod, feeling that going north is the only way you will find anything out.  Silently, your party leaves the area, heading north.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.43.106.1.message" : "\"HEY!\" a voice rumbles.  You look up.  \"Those are my shoes!\"  It is a titan.  Unfortunately, he is accompanied by several of his friends.",

You\"ve been here for hours, relaying the story that Valan told you and how you woke up in the desert remembering nothing.  \"Ahhh,\" was all Sorlan could say between sobs, \"He is a cunning one, he is.\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.43.4.1.message" : "(4)  Without thinking, you blurt out, \"Who are you?\"  Silently, you curse yourself for your lack of control.  This is like a genie\"s wish, not to be wasted frivolously.  Whoever this is, she might be able to answer real questions.  \"I am Inshamam, a Water Spirit.  I sustain the essence of water.\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.44.12.1.message" : "(13) \"An so,\" you finish, \"he had convinced me that you wanted the gold of Akamaresh for yourself, that you would have killed Ellabel for it, that he conspired with me to rescue her, and that the men you sent after us must have reached us in the desert, where they killed her and left me for dead.\"",

	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.45.12.1.message" : "(14) \"And you say this is not how it happened?\" you add, trying to sound unbiased.  The king shakes his head and rubs a cloth on his wet cheeks.  \"No, no... I would never.  Not my Ella.  I knew Valan was up to something for a while. He is an evil man, you can tell by the way he looks at you.\"",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.45.4.1.message" : "(2) Suddenly, a hollow, soothing female voice speaks to you.  The sound is intoxicating, and seems to come from far away, although you can\"t place a direction.  Surely, it doesn\"t come from the watery face in front of you.  \"Greetings, mortal friends,\" the voice intones.",
	"map.l_goldheartex.guards.46.11.1.message" : "(15) You pause to remember the dark lord of Erlos.

	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.0.description" : "It was a dark age when the great city known as Atlantis fell to the bloody,\nfueding families of the surrounding land.  The city had stood gloriously amid\nthe turbulance of centuries, strong and inflexible, against all that was \ncorrupting.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.1.description" : "Atlantis the City of the Dawn as it was so called by it\"s people, a haven of\nsafety and miraculous healing.  So the city was heralded untill the fall of the Glass Tower.  ",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.10.description" : "The Witch Mai-Syli, after many years hunting the Wizard Lassiter, finally succeeded in engineering his demise.  At the rubble strewn Northwest Hold, Lassiter stood his last stand in the fiercest and bloodiest battle of the war, started so long ago. There he fell and the land fell with him.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.11.description" : "The war still rages on. Though Lassiter fell to the Witch of the Southwest,\nothers rose, heroes in their own right. They used artifacts of power, left by the heroes of old, to wage war and hold back the tides of opposing magics\nand armies of the undead.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.12.description" : "The land survived and rebuilt upon the rubble of old.  Atlantis, City of Dawn\narose from the dust of decay to shine and fall again.  And so the story continues on.  Life, what once was, will be again, and so history teaches--death is  not a barrier to life but a sanctuary for the living...",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.13.description" : "And so Legends will also come and go.  And what of the legends of the almighty treasures of those original Six, rumored to have been hidden throughout the land?  And what of the Labryinth, supposedly hidden below this mysterious and warring realm?   ...only time will tell...\n\nThe Seer Praetoriaj.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.2.description" : "The Glass Tower was the seat of power, the gathering place of the Six- those who ruled with a firm and just hand, the city of Atlantis. It was the witch Mai-Syli of Southwest Hold, one of the Six, that brought the tower. It started with the seduction of Solycanti, Death Knight of the Southeast Hold.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.3.description" : "Mai-Syli desired power, in every aspect of the word. But to gain Atlantis, she\nneeded the help of others. Solycanti fell quickly to her feminine graces and just as quickly to her seductive words of power. Lastly, she recruited Dakinai, warlock of the Underworld and Warden of the Labryinth.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.4.description" : "So the Six were sundered though the land was ever unawhere. Three began plotting the downfall of the Atlantis, City of Dawn. One, named Cafca, Knight of Atlantis, began to grow suspicious of whispered talks behind closed doors. Perturbed and growing evermore nervous by the day, began to investigate.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.5.description" : "Several sleepless nights later, Cafca approached his longtime frind, a wizard named Lassiter, of Northwest Hold and a member of the Six, with his troubling thoughts. They quickly agreed that they should bring in the last of the Six, Dionelles, Druid of Northeast Hold, before it was too late.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.6.description" : "But it was far too late.The assassination of Cafca tore through the heart of the land and it\"s people. Fearing for their lives, the two allies of Cafca fled the City of Dawn and met in discourse at a House of Sanctuary, knowing the only foreboding course left to them but unwilling to tread that path",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.7.description" : "The success of the council\"s usurpation led to further turmoil in the heart of the Dawn Land.  The newly founded Triumverate soon proceeded with plans to wipe away the smear of Cafca, razing parts of Atlantis and burning away the old knights legacy in pillars of fire.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.8.description" : "A war began.  More terrible than any vision of cataclysm the world could \nimagine. Atlantis, once a beautiful city, now at the whim of the Necromaner Solycanti, fell to a dark seige.  Under the combined might of Lassiter and Dionelles, the once fabled Atlantis crumbled slowly and not without cost.",
	"map.m_darkatlantis.event.9.description" : "Dakinai, Warlock of the Underworld and Warden of the Labryinth, perished\nin the battle for Atlantis. Dionelles, now called the Golden Druid, fell embracing the Death Knight Solycanti, taking the Necromancer with him to await entrance into the Firmament or, equally likely, Shalio\"va, City of Death.",

The leader of the Demons was called Rae, and he tortured the unfortunate Scorblade with scolding irons.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.11.description" : "While in prison, waiting to be sacrificed, Isopa managed to use his magical skills to burn the ropes that bound them. He and Scorblade quickly fled, but the Demons found out what had happened and gave chase. The evil forces were much quicker than the two and soon caught up.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.12.description" : "Isopa ordered his apprentice to continue running. Scorblade did not want to leave his master but he did as he was told. Isopa halted the Demons with his magic for just enough time to allow Scorblade to escape, but then Isopa himself was overun and slaughtered.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.13.description" : "Scorblade had escaped, but was now masterless. He wandered into the land known as Fend, and rested in the peaceful Northern Kingdom for a while. The one day he was walking through a forest when he spotted something gleaming. He rushed over and dug up the object.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.14.description" : "He found the Armour of Wonder, and as he wore it he felt power coursing through his veins. He felt better in everyway. In the midst of the forest he pledged to have revenge upon Rae has his Demons for what they did to him and Isopa.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.15.description" : "A ghost inhabited that forest, the ghost of saint Barnus who had been killed by Demons decades ago. It heard Scorblade\"s oath and saw power in the young man. He spoke to Scorblade and told him that he would help him. Barnus gave a pair of magical sandals to aid him. ",
	"map.xl_fend.event.16.description" : "The Sandals of the Saint gave Scorblade even more power than his armour, and he set off to scour Fend in search of more power, so that he would be able to challenge Rae. A few brave men joined his quest, impressed by his courage and seeing a sense of destiny in him.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.17.description" : "Barnus directed Scorblade to where an evil cabal of Magi were crafting a magical artefact. Scorblade and his men ambushed them and killed them before Scorblade found the necklace they had been making. Without hesitation he slipped it on.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.18.description" : "The Celestial Necklace of Bliss made Scorblade more brave, mighty and wise than even his sandals had. He visited towns and cities and whipped up support to rid Fend of evil and of Demons. He built a small, but powerful army under his control.  ",
	"map.xl_fend.event.19.description" : "His next artefact came when Barnus told of the whereabouts of a great shield, deep underground. Scorblade marched immediately there and with his force charged into the foul Trogdolytes, Harpies and other creatures that lived there. Under his leadership they easily triumphed.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.2.description" : "But you... you are a visionary. You see the potential for Fend. The lands are rich in resources, and if only the factions could be made to co-operate their armies would be invincible. Of course if they were under your rule, that would be all the better. But alas, that is never to be.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.20.description" : "So Scorblade found the Lion\"s Shield of Courage, and by this time he was almost unstoppable, with a mighty army behind him. However Barnus advised him that he needed a sword as well, for Barnus had foreseen Scorblade in a mighty battle, where a weapon would be invaluable.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.21.description" : "Scorblade ordered the wizards of his realm to make him a powerful magic sword, but the wizards told him that they needed a special type of metal, called Starsilver, the only known location of which was in the far south of Fend, in the wastelands, populated by evil Barbarians.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.22.description" : "So Scorblade marched his army south, and fought a great battle with the evil Goblins and Orcs of the wastelands. After many days fighting the Starsilver was found and returned to the wizards, who constructed the mightiest sword the world had ever seen, the Sword of Judgement.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.23.description" : "With the sword Scorblade thought he had found the greatest artefact ever. He would need it, Barnus told him, for Rae, now a Demon Prince, was soon to invade northern Fend with a huge horde of Demons. But Scorbloade would not be able to defeat them, despite his current army. ",
	"map.xl_fend.event.24.description" : "Barnus told Scorbalde that to defeat Rae he would need the support of the Tar-Anar swamp dwellers and the Rangers of the Unicorn Glades. But he could not afford to wage a war to gain their support, that would take far too long. There was another way.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.25.description" : "Barnus told Scorblade of an artifact even more powerful than the Sword of Judgement. It was buried deep beneath the volcano known as the Mountain of Mourn. The wearer would control all of the people of Fend. It was known as the Helm of Heavenly Enlightenment.  ",
	"map.xl_fend.event.26.description" : "As Scorblade voyaged alone deep in the tunnels under Fend, Barnus told him that the Helm was sent by the Gods themselves to the first king of Fend. Now it was guarded by a dozen Dragons. Scorblade gripped his Sword of Judgement in preparation for the fight.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.27.description" : "With his armour, sandals, necklace, shield and sword Scorblade tore through the Dragons, killing six in a matter of minutes as he ambushed them. But by then the others had gathered their wits and fought back ferociously. Scorblade killed two more before his shield was knocked away.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.28.description" : "He desperately tried to run past the Dragons to the Helm, slashing away he killed two more, but the other two lunged at him, fire burned his skin and claws broke his bones. With his last strength he pulled himself up to where the Helm lay and placed it upon his head.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.29.description" : "Suddebly he was filled with renewed strength and vigour and as the last two Dragons charged once more he chopped off both their heads. Then Barnus appeared and told him to hurry, for Rae was about to attack northern Fend. Scorblade picked up his shield and ran.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.3.description" : "However while looking through an ancient tome you came upon the legend of the Helm of Heavenly Enlightenment. According to the book, whoever wears the Helm becomes ruler of Fend, and all races will look up to him. But the Helm has been lost for centuries!",
	"map.xl_fend.event.30.description" : "Scroblade ran through the Unicorn Glades, and the swamps of the Tar-anar and all who saw his helm followed him without question. Soon he had an army of thousands and reached the Northern Kingdom just in time, as Rae and his Demons attacked.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.31.description" : "Scroblade sought out Rae. However despite his powerful artifacts Rae had grown greatly in power, and was now a mighty demon Prince. The two foes were evenly matched, and the battle between them raged long. But Rae eventually took the upper hand and threw Scorblade to the ground.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.32.description" : "Rae struck Scorblade again and again, mortally wounding him. But at Rae stood and gloated at the dying Scorblade, Scorblade grabbed the Sword of Judgement and plunged it deep through Rae\"s body. The Demon Prince screamed then evaporated.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.33.description" : "The war was won but Scorblade was soon to die. He ordered his artifatcs hidden throughout the lands, except for his helm, which he took with him as he journeyed deep underneath Fend. Finally he found a place to rest with his Helm, and passed away into the afterlife. So ends the legend of Scorblade.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.4.description" : "It seems you were not the only one who had heard of the Helm. A Knight named Mystra was currently searching Fend too. You sent a mesage by Griffon rider to Mystra, asking if she would co-operate with you, so you could aid each other in your quest. She agreed.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.5.description" : "However Mystra also sent a message saying she was in trouble, on the run from a group of evil Overlords and Warlocks called the Order of the Dragon, who dwelt deep underground. It was important to get to Fend quickly, but the quickest way was over a monster infested wasteland.",
	"map.xl_fend.event.6.description" : "However you had a cunning plan, and disguised yourself as the Battle Mage, Gratsnak, and were able to slip past most evil creatures, even managing to recruit some into your army. And now you have arrived, in a corner of Fend known as Goblin Alley.",
